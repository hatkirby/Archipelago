# Anodyne

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the
options you need to configure and export a config file.

## What is the goal?

The goal is to collect 36 cards, make your way into the final area, and defeat
the Briar.

## What is a "check" in Anodyne?

Treasure chests and health cicadas make up the majority of checks. The four
tentacles within the Red Grotto, the trade quest, and activating the Windmill
all also send out checks.

The two treasure chests in the Street (the broom and the small key) both always
give out their vanilla items in addition to sending out checks.

## What "items" can you unlock in Anodyne?

The three large keys, dungeon small keys, broom upgrades, the Jump Shoes, the
trade quest items, health cicadas, and cards are all items. Additionally, the
Windmill statues after the first three dungeons are separate items, rather than
one combined unlock like in the base game. Finally, instead of the Red Grotto
opening up after breaking the chains on the tentacles, there are three
Progressive Red Grotto items corresponding to the three additional entrances to
the dungeon.
