# Anodyne Randomizer Setup

## Required Software

- [Anodyne](https://www.anodynegame.com/)
- [Anodyne Archipelago Randomizer](https://code.fourisland.com/anodyne-archipelago/about/CHANGELOG.md)

## Optional Software

- [Archipelago Text Client](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases)

## Installation

1. Download the Anodyne Archipelago Randomizer from
   [the releases page](https://code.fourisland.com/anodyne-archipelago/about/CHANGELOG.md).
2. Locate `AnodyneSharp.exe`. On Steam, you can find it by right clicking on
   "Anodyne", going to "Manage", and clicking "Browse local files". In the
   folder that opens, you should see another folder called "Remake".
   `AnodyneSharp.exe` should be in there.
3. Unzip the randomizer into the same folder as `AnodyneSharp.exe`. This should
   add one folder, one exe, and several dll files to this folder.

## Joining a Multiworld game

1. Run `AnodyneArchipelagoLauncher.exe`.
2. Enter your connection details on the main menu. Text must be entered via
   keyboard, even if you are playing on controller.
3. Select "Connect".
4. Enjoy!

To continue an earlier game, you can perform the exact same steps as above. The
randomizer will remember the details of your last nine unique connections.

The base game can still be played normally using `AnodyneSharp.exe` (i.e. by
launching the game through Steam). The randomizer will only be invoked when
running the game using `AnodyneArchipelagoLauncher.exe`. The randomizer also
uses separate save files from the main game, so your vanilla saves will not be
affected either.
